Healthcare AI platform


## Vision
This project aims to develop a Healthcare AI Platform that empowers patients and healthcare providers through intelligent, secure, and interoperable AI-driven solutions. We follow a phased, iterative approach, guided by principles of user-centricity, privacy, interoperability, and modularity as we build platform capabilities, incrementally addressing workflows based on value.

## Guiding Principles
- **User-Centricity:** Solutions are designed around patients’ and professionals’ needs.
- **Phased Value Delivery:** Iterative, tangible releases.
- **Agentic First:** Flexible, intelligent, autonomous components via agentic AI frameworks.
- **Data Privacy & Security:** HIPAA-like compliance for PII.
- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration with healthcare systems (EHRs).
- **Modularity & Scalability:** Designed for growth and easy feature/data expansion.
- **Observability:** Robust logging and tracing for agentic behaviors.

## Architecture Overview
We align with Chip Huyen’s GenAI Platform Architecture:

### Phase 1: "Explore" – Patient Empowerment & Initial EHR Interaction
- **Key Use Cases:** Patient health Q&A, appointment booking.
- **Core Components:**
  - User-facing chat interface (web/mobile)
  - Backend orchestrator (“agentic core”)
  - PII redaction, context retriever, LLM interaction, tool execution (web search, EHR booking)
  - Memory (session-based)
  - Observability (Langfuse/Langsmith)

### Phase 2: "Build" – Personalization & Deeper Data Interaction
- **Key Use Cases:** Personalized prescription queries, medication education, refill requests with expert handoff.
- **Enhancements:** Secure user context, private data retrieval, human-in-the-loop dashboard, long-term memory, advanced RAG.

### Future Phases
- Proactive health insights, deeper EHR writes, multi-agent systems, custom model development, robust CI/CD and scaling.

## High-Level Technology Stack
- **Python** (core services, agentic logic)
- **LangChain / agentic frameworks**
- **LLMs:** OpenAI, Hugging Face, or others
- **Observability:** Langfuse, Langsmith
- **Datastore:** Pinecone/Weaviate/Chroma
- **Frontend:** React/Vue
- **EHR Integration:** FHIR APIs/Platform APIs
- **Cloud:** AWS/GCP/Azure
